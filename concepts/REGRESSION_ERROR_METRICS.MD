# Regression Error Metrics
Regression is a task when a model attempts to predict continuous values (not categorical values - which is classification)

Examples of Evaluating Regression:
1. Attempting to predict the price of a house given its features.
    - (predicting the country a house is in is classification)
    
Common Evaluation Metrics:

### Mean Absolute Error (MAE)


The mean of the absolute value of errors. For example:
- Compare the prediction of the house price to the true house price.

Take the difference between true price minus the predicted price & take the absolute value.



### Mean Squared Error

### Root Mean Square Error
