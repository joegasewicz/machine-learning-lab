### Graphs 

##### Histogram
- Each bar covers an interval & is centered at the midpoint.
- The bars height is the number of data points in the interval.

#### Relative Frequency Histogram
- Same as the histogram but the vertical axis represents relative frequency

***

### Spread

#### Interquartile Range
- Divide the data into equal groups & see how far apart the extreme groups are.
- Q1 is the median of the lows / Q3 is the median of the highs

$IQR = Q3 - Q1$
