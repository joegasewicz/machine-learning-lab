##### Mean (*or average*)
- The mean of average value is represented by $\overline{x}$.
- The mean is sensitive to outliers

$$
\overline{x} = \displaystyle\sum_{i=0}^n \frac{xi}{n}
$$

#### Median
- The midpoint of the data.
- The mean is sensitive to outliers
- e.g If we have `5 7 3 38 7`
  - Arrange the data in order from smallest to largest - `3 5 7 7 38`
- Of the number of points is even (there is no middle number)
then average 2 values around the middle. e.g `3 5 7 7`

$\frac{5+7}{2} = 6$
